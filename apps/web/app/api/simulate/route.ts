  "[DEP] Milton et al. — Double Empathy Problem (2022): 'the double empathy problem refers to a breakdown in mutual understanding — a problem for both parties — interaction between autistic and non-autistic people as a primarily mutual and interpersonal issue.' → Social situations feel confusing and unsafe not because of a deficit but because of a genuine mismatch in communication styles.\n" +
  "[EPF] Mottron et al. — Enhanced Perceptual Functioning (2006): 'locally oriented visual and auditory perception, enhanced low-level discrimination… autonomy of low-level information processing toward higher-order operations.' → Small details are processed more intensely than the whole; a button or a texture may dominate over a face.\n" +
  "[G-AUD] Grandin — Auditory experience: 'My hearing is like having a hearing aid with the volume control stuck on super loud… an open microphone that picks up everything… I can't modulate incoming auditory stimulation.' → All sounds arrive at equal volume; background noise competes with speech.\n" +
  "[G-TAC] Grandin — Tactile experience: 'petticoats itched and scratched… Most people adapt… Even now… it takes me three to four days to fully adapt.' → Clothing, textures, physical contact remain consciously present rather than fading to background.\n" +
  "Additional grounding concepts: monotropism (attention tunnels deeply into one thing, switching is costly); interoception differences (internal body signals — hunger, pain, heartbeat — are either amplified or absent); masking/camouflaging (constant conscious effort to perform neurotypical behavior drains cognitive resources); emotional processing differences (emotions are felt intensely but may not surface in expected facial expressions).";

    "NON-NEGOTIABLE RULES:\n" +
    "- First-person POV only. Camera IS the eyes. Never show protagonist.\n" +
    "- Single continuous shot. No cuts.\n" +
    "- Photorealistic. No morphing, no ghosting, no artifacts.\n" +
    "- No text, no subtitles.\n\n" +

    "- Dark circular vignette - bright center, edges fade to near-black\n" +
    "- Colors slightly oversaturated\n" +
    "- Subtle physiological tremor - never completely still\n" +
    "- Focus drifts in and out periodically - world goes soft then refocuses\n\n" +

    "CONVERGENCE - everyone moves toward the camera:\n" +
    "- People walk TOWARD the camera, not past it\n" +

    "One stranger → face fills 50-60% of frame, mouth slightly out of sync, camera drifts away then returns\n" +
    "Small group → camera jumps between faces, cannot settle, one irrelevant detail competes\n" +
    "Crowd → faces from all directions, lights overexposed, tunnel vision, edges blur\n" +
    "Unexpected change → camera fixates obsessively on the wrong element, cannot look away\n" +
    "Nature/quiet → slow drift, textures get attention, rare moment of peace\n\n" +
